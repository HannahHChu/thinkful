    "With the rise in uncontrolled bee deterrents such as insecticides, mites, and other pathogenic diseases, beekeeping has become unpopular over the past few decades in the US(Ellis et al., 2010; Potts et al., 2010; Morse, 2000). This trend is demonstrated by data collected from 2010-2016 on managed honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies. Decline in honey beekeeping not only impacts agricultural communities economically, but also affects the pollination of many essential plants (Neumann & Carreck, 2010). The negative impacts of colony decline on the community and the pressure it places on the ecosystem have pushed the issue to the forefront of public attention, now popularly termed \"Colony Collapse Disorder\" (CCD)*. However, with the popularity of the problem, there has been widespread misinformation about the causes and effects of bee colony loss (Neumann & Carreck, 2010). However, a study done in 2009 by vanEngelsdorp and Meixner have shown that colony loss is not an uncommon occurence. This historical decline was found to be caused by a viral infection, named “Isle of Wight Disease” (Bailey and Ball, 1991; Bailey, 2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though a closer examination of this [dataset](https://bip2.beeinformed.org/hive-scales/config/about) provided by The Bee Informed Partnership (BIP) may not explain why bee colonies have been declining, it can help us better understand th relationship between beekeeping and bee colony health. \n",
    "\n",
    "(The BIP was initially funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) but has now become non-for-profit organization that works with beekeepers nationally to promote the health of bees.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: CCD is a term only used for HONEY bees (Genus: Apis). It does not apply to other bees such as bumblebees (Genus: Bombus), sweat bees (Genus: Lasioglossum), and many others.*"
